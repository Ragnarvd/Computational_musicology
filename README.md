Corpus Description

The main goal of this corpus is to compare playlists, to be specific, compare study playlists.
A lot of people study, and a lot of people study while listening to music. All people are different and we also see this in their music taste; it's often said that classical music is great for studying and this is also backed by different studies but there also a lot of other kinds of music that students listen to: LoFi, techno etc.

In this corpus Iâ€™ll take different Spotify music playlists and try to compare them; what are the differences between the different playlists? Without their label is there a big difference?
