Corpus Description

The main goal of this corpus is to compare playlists, to be specific, compare study playlists.
A lot of people study, and a lot of people study while listening to music. All people are different and we also see this in their music taste; it's often said that classical music is great for studying and this is also backed by different studies but there also a lot of other kinds of music that students listen to: LoFi, techno etc.

In this corpus Iâ€™ll take different Spotify music playlists and try to compare them; what are the differences between the different playlists? Without their label is there a big difference?

I will work with four different playlists all created by spotiff: a pop study playlist, a classical music study playlist, a techno study playlist and a LoFi study playlist.

Classical Studying music: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EIgLoMVUd9oTU
Electronic Focus: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0wMD4IoQ5aJ
Chill Lofi Study Beats: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8Uebhn9wzrS

My hypothesis for this research is that there will be a lot of similarities, probably a low bpm and not too energetic for example. But I hope to find some interesting differences that I can then investigate further and possibly explain.
